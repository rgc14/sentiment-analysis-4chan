Title:
I wish I was my friend's yandere boyfriend
Body:
I literally can't stop thinking about him. Whenever I think about him finding someone other than me, all I can think about is how much I want that hypothetical person to die a horrible death.

I'm otherwise a normal friend, and, by his own admission, his only friend. I like seeing him talk to other people because it makes him happy, but everyday I'm scared of him starting to like someone more than me. I like that he's becoming more confident, however, that comes with the risk of him one day realising that he's too good for me. I doubt he has feelings for me (though he has admitted that he's bi) and confessing is scary. I wish I could just eliminate the competition and be his one and only.

I want to be by his side for the rest of my life and the thought of him picking someone else while I stay as (at most) his best mate terrifies me.

I want to confess to him under some lovely tree like a stereotypical romance anime confession while he's completely oblivious to the psycho yandere business I was up to just hours before. I want him to love me and to become as obsessed with me as I am with him.

I would survive even if he was the only human interaction I ever had. He's my everything and I'm too much of a pussy to tell him. I only need him and it's killing me.

How do I make him like me? I need him to be mine but I'm not actually capable of abusing him or killing off the competition. Outside of fantasy, I just want to marry him.
